# MOBILE_AS_WIRELESS_GESTURE_CONTROLLER
Since everyone cannot afford to buy a controller for gaming purposes. This project aims to provide free game controllers. Where any android 
phone can be converted into wireless gesture controlled gaming controller.

The major limitation of the project is that it works only games based on DirectX.

This whole project consist of an APK file named SENSOR UDP(The creator of the the app is someone else which I found on the web, If you are the creator send me your credentials I will take it down.)

So this consist of an apk file which sends accelerometer data from phone to the computer through UDP packets.And on the computer there's a python script running which takes in the accelerometer data and converts them into desired output for the game.
